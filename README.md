# Healthy-Lifestyle-Prediction
A Python Machine Learning project that predicts Disease risk for a specific lifestyle.

# Introduction
This project contains information about the health state of individuals, such as(BMI, alcohol consumption,**disease_risk**, etc), and it has 3 machine learning models that can predict whether an individual is at risk of disease or not.

### How large is this dataset?
The dataset contains 100,000 records
### What steps were taken in this project?
**1. Explore the data**

**2. Cleaning the data:** handing missing value,outliers,..etc

**3. EDA:** making appropriate visualization to explore important features and trends

**4. Data preprocessing:** handling imbalanced data, scaling, and pre-processing object datatype of the gender column to make sure that the  model will get reliable results

**5. Model training and Evaluation:** train 3 models and evaluate their accuracy to find the appropriate one

# Analysis goals
To predict whether an individual is at risk of disease or not.

# Results and insights
After applying Logistic regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, we find that the Random Forest performs better in this dataset
